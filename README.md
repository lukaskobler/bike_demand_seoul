Bike Demand Prediction using XGBoost

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use the XGBoost algorithm to predict bike demand in Seoul. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/lukaskobler/bike_demand_seoul.git
cd bike_demand_seoul
2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, if you're using pip-compile, generate the requirements.txt first:

pip install pip-tools
pip-compile requirements.in
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
5. Open the Notebook
In the Jupyter interface, open the xgboost_seoul_bike_demand.ipynb notebook and follow along with the steps.
